# Movie Recommender System: Project Overview

+ Developed a tool that recommends movies to its users when to help them in watching similar movies.

+ Used TMDB dataset containing data of 5000 movies and processed it using python.

+ Engineered features from the text using NLTK to remove stopwords and vectorize the characteristics of each movie such as cast, director, genres, and taglines.

+ Found the distance of each vector from one other in the 5000-dimensional space.

+ Built an interactive app using Streamlit to display recommendations.

+ Displayed the images tags of each movie after fetching data from TMDB API.
